# Bengaluru House Price Prediction üè°

## Overview
A machine learning project predicting house prices in Bengaluru using Linear Regression.  
The workflow includes data cleaning, feature engineering, EDA, and model building.

## Dataset
- Source: Kaggle - Bengaluru House Prices dataset
- Features include location, square feet, BHK, bathrooms, and price.

## Workflow
1. Data preprocessing (handled missing values, converted sqft ranges, created new features)
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (price per sqft, location trends, outlier detection)
3. Model Building ‚Äì Linear Regression
4. Model Evaluation ‚Äì train/test split and error metrics

## Tech Stack
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Jupyter)

## Results
- Achieved a reliable predictive model for property pricing.
- Demonstrated end-to-end ML pipeline development.
